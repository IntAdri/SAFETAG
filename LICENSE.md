If you have further questions related to licensing [PLEASE create an issue about it on github.](https://github.com/OpenInternet/SAFETAG/issues) We are excited to discuss how we can best support those who wish to use SAFETAG and best attribute those whose content we adapted or redistributed through SAFETAG.

## Usage of "SAFETAG"

SAFETAG is itself a framework and template for organizational audits.  As such, audits performed which use or adapt SAFETAG materials may be referred to as "adapting the SAFETAG methodology" or "based on the SAFETAG framework", and similar phrasings, but may NOT be called "SAFETAG audits".

This is not intended to imply that an audit using any or all of the SAFETAG materials need to refer to SAFETAG at all.

This usage policy does not affect the distribution of SAFETAG materials, covered in the license statement above.
