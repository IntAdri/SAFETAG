**Identify and rank vulnerabilities**

* Identify the possible impact of the vulnerability.
* Identify any threats to critical process' the vulnerability makes possible.
* Identify the process with the greatest impact if interrupted.
* Identify the possibility of exploitation.
* Identify the level of resources required to exploit the vulnerability.
* Compare the resources required against the capabilities identified in the risk modeling activities and the contextual research you completed.




**Build a vulnerability/likelihood matrix**

* Position the vulnerability on the risk matrix in relation to its likelihood and its impact.

**Create a risk matrix**

* Place *impacts* against a range of likelihood.
* Clean up critical process maps for use in reporting.
* Create a list of all services or assets that were identified during the activity that were not already known by the auditor.
