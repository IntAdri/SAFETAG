Vulnerability prioritization is a critical process. It is vital that the reasoning an auditor uses during this stage are documented and available within the report. If an auditor does not create accurate associations between the host identified impact or uses an inaccurate assessment of adversary capabilities it can lessen the credibility of the recommendations made.

After the activities are complete the auditor has tasks that build upon the outputs of the activities.

* Chart vulnerabilities against likelihood
* A short overview of the how the likelihood was determined for each vulnerability.
* A listing of the process, impact, and likelihood for each vulnerability.
* Create a risk matrix placing *impacts* against a range of likelihood.
* An overview of the risks the organization is accepting until they address each vulnerability.
