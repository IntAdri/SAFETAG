Doxing (also "doxxing", or "d0xing", a word derived from "documents", or "docs") consists in tracing and gathering information about someone using sources that are freely available on the internet (called OSINT, or Open Source INTelligence).

Doxing is premised on the idea that "The more you know about your target, the easier it will be to find their flaws‚Äù. A malicious actor may use this method to identify valuable information about their target. Once they have found sensitive information, they may publish this information for defamation, blackmail the target person, or use it for other goals.

This activity aims to help participants understand how much of their personal information is publicly available online, and how to prevent it from being used by an adversary.
