**Self-Doxing to Prevent Doxing**

Harassers and stalkers use several tools and techniques to gather information about their targets, but since these tools and techniques are mostly public and easy to use, we can also use them ourselves, on ourselves, as a preventative measure. "Self-doxing" can help us make informed decisions about what we share online, and how. (Of course, these same instruments can also be used to learn more than is immediately obvious about someone we have met online before we give them our full trust  - for example to decide if we want to admit them to a private mailing list or group on social networking platforms.)

Methods used for doxing (and self-doxing!) include exploring archives, yellow pages, phone directories and other publicly available information; querying common search engines like Google or [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com); looking for a person's profile in specific services; searching for information in public forums and mailing lists; or looking for images that the person has shared (and for instance may have also published in another, more personal, account). But it can also simply consist in looking up the public information on the owner of a website, through a simple "whois search".

**Warning**: when practicing self-doxing, there is a risk of getting exposed to results that you may find disturbing. If you think you may need support, make sure you have close friends around when you do your research.

Before we start exploring these web services and looking for our digital self, it's a good idea to use anonymisation tools like the [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/).
