### What to search for

To decide what to search for, you should try to understand what activities expose you to a higher risk of being attacked by trolls or other malicious actors. Why would someone want to spend hours of their time to track information on you in the internet?

This kind of attacks often affects minorities or people who support controversial opinions online, and the attack starts from the information that the malicious actor will find immediately available - like the nickname and profile used by the target in the platform where the attack has started, or the pictures the target has published in their page.

So if you think that someone might want to harm you by looking for personal information on you, start asking yourself how they got to know you. If you use your name and surname or a picture of your face on the platform where they learned about your existence, then this is what they will start from, and what you should start from for your self-doxing exercise.

If, on the other hand, a potential attacker knows you by a pseudonym (like the nickname or handle you use on that platform), your search efforts should focus on any connection that there might be between that pseudonym and your physical life (your name and surname, the place where you work, your home address, etc.).

If you are using a unique handle in the platform where your sensitive activity is happening, and have never used it for anything else, some traces might still be public, for example your IP address or your geolocation data. Check the properties of the pictures you've uploaded and the posts you've published: do they contain any identifying details, like your IP address or your location? If so, you might want to edit them so as to delete any sensitive information they may contain. Read more on how to control the information you share online in this [guide on secure identity management](https://gendersec.tacticaltech.org/wiki/index.php/Step_1#Control_the_content_and_metadata_you_share).


### Search engines and more

Once you have identified all the names and nicknames you want to look for, as well as pictures and other personal data (web domains you own, birth date, city where you live, etc.) you may have posted in your most exposed online profiles and web pages, you can start your search.

What follows is a list of search engines and other online services that you can use.

When you do your search, use a different browser than usual so that you arenâ€™t logged into your online accounts. In alternative, you can [delete the history and cookies, and clear the cache](https://datadetox.myshadow.org/detox/day1/1-make-a-fresh-start).

- The most obvious place to start a search is **Google**. Before you start your search there, please note that on your usual browser Google may give you customized results that might not match with what an adversary would find. It's better to use a different browser to do this search (for example if you usually use Firefox, use Chrome for this search, or, even better, the [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/)).
    - Remember that if you are looking for more than one word, like your name and surname, you can refine your search by putting quotation marks (") around the words, as in: "Name Surname".

- Repeat your search on other search engines, like **[DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/)** and **[Bing](https://www.bing.com/)**.

- Look for your name or nickname in the most common social networking platforms: are other people trying to impersonate you?

- Your name might be in the White Pages, together with your home address. Research in the local platforms available (White pages, citizen registry, voter's registry, etc)


#### Image searches

If you have a photo, icon, or avatar, do a TinEye or Google reverse image search. With these search engines you can look for all the pages that contain the image you are searching for.

For example, if you use your portrait for your Facebook profile, you can check that this picture hasn't been used in other web pages by looking for the URL of your icon. To find out what the URL of your icon is, right-click the image and click "Copy Image Location", then paste the URL in the search engine bar.

- [TinEyE](https://tineye.com/) image search
- For a Google reverse image search, go to [Google Images](https://tineye.com/) and click on the camera icon on the right end of the search bar, then paste the URL of the image in the search box.

#### Check if your online account has been previously compromised

Over the years, many company and platform databases have been breached, and the user names, email addresses, and passwords in those databases published online. You can find out if any of your accounts' credentials are included in these leaked databases by looking for your email on [';--have i been pwned?](https://haveibeenpwned.com/).

If you find an account of yours was compromised, and you are using that same password for other accounts, you should immediately change that password.
