###### Establishing trust and leveraging safe spaces

Not every auditor will be able to do fear mapping because the process requires the ability to build trust and an active listening skill. Fear mapping is an individual person-by-person effort and not a group exercise, since group dynamics usually affect the conversation. This process requires trust and time, so we cannot expect input from everybody in the organization, but it may be useful to get at least 50% of the interviewed people to respond, because otherwise the results will be useless.

Consider different, culturally, inter-personally, and organizationally appropriate ways to have these conversations in safe(r), calming, and non-threatening environments. One auditor currently does that by getting out of the office of the audited organization with people individually and talk to them in an informal environment (e.g. during lunch). She provides concrete grounding by starting this conversation by mentioning known recent incidents and asking questions ("How do you feel about this incident?").

* Create a safe space for the discussion by being careful with language, tone, terminology, examples, scenarios, etc. (empathy is key)
* Minimize any hierarchy in the relationship by empowering, leading by example, speaking to their level of understanding i.e. be where they are at in the moment (realistic expectations);
* Know what words, terms, examples, etc could be triggers when discussing security threats and try to avoid them;
* Understand that they may process trauma, fears, worries, anxieties, etc during the audit and have a response/reaction plan in mind (taking on the role of a container, if appropriate); and
* Remember that digital security is an important aspect of self-care and well-being; individuals become more aware and empowered to take their personal security and safety into their own hands.

###### Surveying Fear

Before asking questions about fears, an auditor may need to explain what's going on and how this is useful and relevant to the audit, because otherwise people will be confused (e.g. Schneier's "feeling, model, reality" model from this TED https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGd_M_CpeDI , we are addressing the "feeling" part here). During these interviews we also need to ask people what they want us to do with the information, whether they want us to share any of it with management. ("Would you like me to bring it up with management without mentioning your name?"). If people do not want us to bring it up, we don't.

The interview questions may include (on a scale of 0 to 5, or list):

* How often do you feel afraid or worried? (0 to 5) (never .. constantly)
* Are any specific fears affecting your day to day work? (list)
* If you are worried about specific security incidents, what are those incidents? (list)
* How comfortable are you using technology at work? (0 to 5)
* Do you trust the people with whom you work (coworkers, partners, beneficiaries)? (0 to 5)
* Do you generally trust the technologies which you are using (software, service providers, cloud/email providers, etc.)? (0 to 5)
* Are there any technologies which you trust less/which cause more fear or anxiety than others? Why? (list)
* What do you do if you feel that way? (ideally, list of behaviors) Have these fears interfere with your performance at work? (0 to 5)
