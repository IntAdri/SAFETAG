"Fear Mapping" refers to the structured attempts to capture the levels of fear and anxiety in an organization during the audit process. This may be useful because fear paralyzes people and hinders organizational change.

The purpose is to compare the staff's fears with the results of a risk assessment, and capture high fear levels. Also, we may want to identify people who are much more or much less paranoid than others for training purposes.
