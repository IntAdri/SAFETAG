It is increasingly difficult to run complex organizations without some reliance on cloud-based service providers such as email hosting, web hosting, or document management/backup. Organizations (and as assisted by the auditor) should review their options in the selection of cloud providers, and in parallel consider ways to apply practices and policies to their use to meet organizational security requirements.  

##### Cloud Service Provider Review

* In conjunction with Data Mapping, review what data is stored in which cloud service(s), and who (organizationally) has access to that data.
* Map out what data and/or metadata the provider has access to
* Review the posted Terms of Service and Privacy Policies
* Review the transparency report of the provider and what jurisdictions it operates in. Are there local data storage laws in effect?
* Does the provider have account protection services meeting the requirements of the organization (e.g. 2FA)
* Search for security breaches impacting the service, and review their response (See https://haveibeenpwned.com/PwnedWebsites).  Note that a breach itself is not cause to not use a service, but revelations on what was breached and how quickly, transparently, and effectively the provider responded should impact decisions.
* Where relevant, review any security/product whitepapers posted on their service and implementation.
* Look for any records (and/or request from the company) information about audits of their systems/code

##### Internal/Organizational Considerations

- Back-up and availability - One of the major risks with an external service is that they will go out of business and/or the data might become inaccessible due to factors outside of the organization's control.  Does the provider have guarantees in terms of availability here, and/or what practices can the organization leverage to have additional backup/export options.
- Is the organization implementing the best practices put in place by the company offering the service? E.g login processes - 2FA..
- What are the password management practices for the cloud/web based services? Account credentials - who opened the accounts and how they are accessible in their absence?
- How are logins to the service managed when employees leave or when temporary access is required for a contractor or partner?
