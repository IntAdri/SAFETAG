* Not all teleconferencing technology is made equal. Be sure to evaluate the risks of using a technology prior to engaging in sensitive conversations online.
* Given the complexity of managing several small groups virtually, it is helpful to have a point of contact at the organization to assist in coordinating logistics. Determine who this might be at the beginning of the audit. 
* Staying organized is critical and the logistics document is very helpful as both a communication tool for the organization and to keep the auditor organized and efficient to move through the exercise as quickly as possible.
* [The Asset Valuation Table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Yf2S6IIOlewzTSBNT-yJ1P9ZZD2d3XVN/edit?dls=true#gid=848553981): The template is ideally completed in two phases: 1) Iterating Assets; 2) Evaluating the Sensitive of those Assets, so as not to ask too much of the group all at once. However, in past audits, most groups skipped ahead and proceeded to do both steps per asset. This caused some groups to not progress as quickly as others. Try to emphasize doing one step at a time to not overload groups with tasks.
* Regular check-ins within the breakout groups. Set clear times you will check-in with each group (e.g. after 5m, mid point, 5m remaining).
* Coordinating online takes time. Give yourself some buffer, as the logistics always takes longer than expected. This is especially true of groups less familiar with the teleconferencing technology you may be using.
