* Compare the resources required against the capabilities identified in the risk modeling activities and the contextual research you completed.
* Based upon the organizational capacity assessment, build a menu that builds upon the organizational strengths to create a path forward that provides achievable outcomes, maintains agency, and steps towards long-term difficult outcomes with high reward for the host.

* **Implementation Matrix Development:** Create an "implementation matrix." with the urgency of the threat addressed balanced by the difficulty of implementation given available organizational capacity for the recommendations.
* **Roadmap Development:** Identify critical vulnerabilities, with achievable recommendations that fit into threat narratives that you heard from staff during the audit to create a remediation roadmap for addressing the threats faced by the organization. Include a short description of why each recommendation (and corresponding threat) was ranked with the urgency it was assigned.
* **Documenting Existing Successes:** Place the  recommendations on a time-line that includes the existing practices of the organization to show that the remediation process is a continuation of the hosts existing in/formal security practices. [^shostack_anchoring]
