Part of modern life is having a presence on-line.  For many organizations, their online work is key to their success.  It is overall important to understand how disparate pieces of data can be combined by a dedicated adversary to build a deep understanding of the organization and its employees, which is useful in "social engineering" attacks such as  "spear-phishing" -- sending professional, seemingly relevant emails with malicious attachments.

Monitoring sites (like pastebin with tools like [pasteLert](http://www.andrewmohawk.com/pasteLert/)) for information about your organization can help detect breaches, especially by cyber-criminals. However, it is generally more valuable to expend limited resources on constant updates of the web server, CMS system (e.g. Joomla), and plugins.

Running images through tools to remove "EXIF" data is useful, particularly when the images come from devices (such as smartphones) with GPS built-in.

Consider the risk of doxing, which affects particularly organizations with a focus on topics that carry a social stigma - OSINT-based attacks can affect for example single members of women's and LGBTQ rights organizations. In these cases the research described in this exercise should also be carried out on the most visible persons of the organization. This activity can be combined with the Self-Doxing exercise to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities without intruding into team members' privacy.
