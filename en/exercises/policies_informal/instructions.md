1. Build a list of situations where security policies, if followed, would prevent or reduce the impact of a problem; ideally using the Threat Modeling exercise and inputs from Process Mapping, Capacity Assessment, and other methods and activities. These situations can be related to regular operations (looking for best practices) and risks (looking for security procedures).

For small and medium sized organizations, arrange group conversations around a few specific what-if scenarios (this can be integrated in with the Data Mapping or Process Mapping approaches).

Discussions can include:

  * How passwords are created, used, and shared
  * Who has access to what information (e.g. HR, finance, partners)
  * Destruction/loss of office devices (fire, natural disaster, etc.)
  * Lost devices (e.g. while traveling)
  * Data breach impacting a cloud service used by the organization
  * New people join or leave the organization

2. Meet with members of the organization and present to them the situations on the previous list, asking if there are some codes or agreements regarding security aspects of the situations presented, take notes of the responses and possible differences between the criteria or knowledge of the agreements. This could be explained by the lack of documentation and formal ways to transmit the agreements

3. Build a map of practices in three terms:


* small org - getting to shared agreements
        * Roundtable without auditor - short internal discussion
        * Run alongside threat ID / process mapping
        * funding and resources


* What practices are presumed to be in place (e.g. everyone thinks everyone else is using unique passwords)
* What is being applied in practice  (with their possible variations among staff members)
* What needs to be updated or defined
