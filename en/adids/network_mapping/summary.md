This takes participants through the process of mapping the local network, discovering routers and servers as well as user devices.  In addition, participants will learn basic vulnerability discovery/scanning and traffic analysis.

**Note that while in an active audit, the password creation process would be done before travel, the teaching flow of this works better directly connected to the network access component.**
