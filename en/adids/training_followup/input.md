### Input

#### Collaborative audits

Responsibly running an auditor training program requires not just an initial training, but ongoing mentorship and support for newly trained auditors to be shadowed by a more experienced auditor during a live audit. This ensures that the audited organization received a responsibly executed and quality assessment while providing invaluable auditing experience to new trainees.

The more experienced auditor should act as a support staff for the new trainee and let them lead the audit process. The experienced auditor should ensure daily pre- and post- check-ins to review the audit plan, overall timeline, and discuss modifications or challenges, as well as be on hand and observing the process of the audit and be ready to step in if thre is a problem.

#### Remote Collaborative Audits

While the collaborative audit process provides rich interaction, additional training opportunities, and good feedback both to improve the SAFETAG training process and the audit framework itself, sending a senior auditor is not always possible due to cost, time, and security limitations.

In these situations, a "remote" collaboration draft method is detailed below, to accommodate even in drastic time-zone differences.

##### Operational Security Notes

In traditional collaborative audits, the organization gets to connect directly with the senior auditor.  This connection is lacking in the remote method, and the auditors need to respect this challenge.  This adds complexity to the interaction, and requires the auditors to very carefully exchange the highly sensitive data of the audit process, as well as set up expectations amongst themselves and for the organization on who has access to the data.

It is impossible to guarantee these processes (the remote auditor can, once they have access, technically do anything with the data), so the client is putting a lot of trust into the auditors, and the auditors must be flexible in adapting to their concerns.

Data sharing:

* context research / interview notes sharing
* nmap and vulnerability scan results
* cropped packet captures of interest
* photos of critical data, process mapping, other staff activity outputs

Daily check-ins:

* Discuss documents from previous work
* Review the process, challenges, adaptations of the current day
* Share documents of the current day, with any specific notes for the mentor to look at.
* Discuss the plan for the next day and the overall audit cycle progress


#### Independent Audit Check-ins

* Daily summaries
* Survey
