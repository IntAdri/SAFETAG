### Input

#### Recommendation Development

It is important to find the right balance to support actual adoption and use - tools which are difficult and complex to adopt may "solve" more vulnerabilities, but if the organization doesn't have the interest, capacity, or ability to adopt them, then you have not made any progress in making them safer.  

Be clear about problems that the recommendations don’t address or won’t address.

When recommending possible solutions:

 * Think about the capacity and challenges
 * multiple levels / approaches to solutions
 * short, long-term
 * technical, training, & policy fixes


#### Resources

Resource identification

* Identifying resources
  * training resources, digital security rapid & long-term response resources, technology hubs, funding sources for supporting these types of organizations, etc.
  * in-region
  * out of region
* Sorting resources
* Identifying DIY resources


 * Training, funding, tech support, emergency resources, legal support
 * Trust: googling is not the solution
 * Opsec when reaching out
 * Guidance for org instead of an e-mail
 * Community resources: Rapid response network, LevelUp community, TTC, FLD, ...
 * Remembering resources that the org mentioned they already have
 * Auditor being a resource to help them identify resources in the future

#### Roadmaps

Providing information to orgs in digestible, understandable fashion: charts, visualizations of recommendations against risk and ease.  Use visuals such as the Implementation Matrix and ranking by the risk matrix to connect your report to work done collaboratively during the audit.

Building a org roadmap based upon:

*  Achievable gains ,   flow for the org to keep them motivated, Works towards the difficult long-term recommendations
* Adding what they have already done to the recommendations
* Explaining why each recommendation was giving its place in the roadmap to the organization

The Report should be a guide for resolutopn and a follow-up assessment

  * Triage
	* Progression roadmap w/ level of effort
	* Long-term solution
	* Skills to look for in the person who will fix this.
  * Training/Skill Development Needed
