The physical access component of SAFETAG is a VERY limited physical security component focused on how to mitigate against threats that occur because of the arrangement of digital assets in the physical world. This is NOT in any way a full physical security audit. SAFETAG auditors are not expected to have in-depth knowledge of locks or security hardware. The SAFETAG physical security methodology addresses basic physical practices for supporting data/network security and recovery.
