### Input

#### Intro to SAFETAG

  * What is SAFETAG
    * The [TRI approach](https://safetag.org/2018/08/16/SAFETAGStories-dropbox.html)
  * Why audits?
  * What SAFETAG isn’t:
    * Pen testing
    * Digital Security Training
    * Hands-on fixing (why?)

#### Risk Assessments, vulnerability assessments, and pentesting: an overview

  * The core of the audit (risk modeling)
  * Traditional Vulnerability Assessments
  * Traditional Risk assessments
  * Using pentesting
    * The perils of pen testing
    * The possibilities of pen testing

#### Overview of Framework and process

  * The Scope of a SAFETAG Audit
  * How the components merge into each other
  * The importance of adaptation - SAFETAG is not a monolithic, do-everything-in-an-exact order process.  By nature each organization will be different, and SAFETAG is intended to provide an organized toolbox of different activities to achieve a goal of a comprehensive risk assessment of the organization's digital security approach.
  * The training will follow a more structured process and highlight activities to work through the material, build and assess critical skills, and show a range of different approaches to SAFETAG assessments; but auditors should not feel constrained to follow this specific flow and indeed are encouraged to create their own "favorites" and approaches, or create new ones to share with the community.

##### Goals

  * We are trying to find the best leverage points to build a risk assessment out of the “top” vulnerabilities identified for a quick impactful audit.
  * This creates strong by in and deeper understanding of how technology interacts with their security needs


##### Responsibilities

Auditors have access to a wealth of sensitive information and unusual access to organizational leadership. In addition to operational security, auditors and the organizations they work with have important responsibilities to each other.

...to the Organization

  * outcomes
  * report
  * on-going conversation
  * connection to resources
  * Creating the ability to run their own risk assessments style activities when thinking of new activities
able to ask the right questions

...of Internews for auditors

  * Respecting privacy: we won’t share org risk data with funder
  * support for you when you are doing audits (financial and communication)

...of the Auditors

  * Customizing to fit an organization’s needs and your skills
  * Currently represents the complete path, not the only path.
  * Things can be dropped or customized, in fact they should
  * Select the right tools for the job
