### Input

  * The SAFETAG structure and repository
    * The [SAFETAG Contribution Guide](https://github.com/SAFETAG/SAFETAG/blob/master/en/document_matter/CONTRIBUTING.md)
    * What it has (curricula, overview guide, full guide, resources)
  * Tools in SAFETAG
    * Tools are only suggestions based upon what works for us. Use whatever makes you feel comfortable. We are going to be prescriptive, that is just to give you the toolbox. Find another tool, use it, tell us, we will add it as an alternative.
    * For tool specific guides, we use external documentation as much as we can. But, most are horribly documented.
  * The SAFETAG Community
    * The [SAFETAG Code of Conduct](https://github.com/SAFETAG/SAFETAG/blob/master/en/document_matter/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
    * Git Issues
    * email lists and chats
